# Find the Nyms

## Summary
Find the Nyms is an educational game built in 3 days in JavaScript by [Jennifer Wong](https://github.com/wongjenn) and [Matt Fender](https://github.com/mjfender), students at the Flatiron School in NYC.

In the game, two players take turns trying to correctly identify the synonyms and antonyms of a given root word. Each round lasts 30
seconds. The round ends when the player makes three mistakes or wins 5 total points. Players win one point for correct answers and lose one
point for incorrect answers. The game ends when a level ends and one or both players have reached 15 points. Players may also choose to end
the game between levels.

## Technical Details
The app is built with Javascript (object-oriented / MVC pattern) and the jQuery library. It uses the responsive Materialize CSS framework and some custom Google Fonts.

## Future Versions
With just a few days to create the game concept and build it, we focused on creating a fully-functioning MVP that would demonstrate the
concept of an educational word game. Given more time, our wish list for future versions include:
* Connect to a thesaurus API to expand the list of hard-coded rootwords, antonyms / synonyms and filler words
* Create additional levels beyond antonyms and synonyms (ex: vocabulary building rounds)
* Add animation, sounds and other effects when the user interacts with DOM elements
